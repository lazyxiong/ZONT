Zont is a russian word for umbrella.
This simple Rake-based test framework (monitor) which allows you to
run arbitrary tests and generate reports - works like an umbrella for your testsuite.
For more info and usage run: rake help

Formerly it was hosted by my other github account: http://github.com/lazybear
