Zont is a russian word for umbrella.
This simple Rake-based test framework (monitor) which allows you to
run arbitrary tests and generate reports - works like an umbrella for your testsuite.
ZONT is test-agnostic, that is - it doesn't know about what your tests do and how they are written.

Formerly it was hosted by my other github account: http://github.com/lazybear

Among its features are:

- ability to run tests in parallel using DRb (distributed ruby)
- keyword-based test execution (filter tests by keywords, much like gmail labels)
- creation of 2 types of reports: human-readable .html reports and .xml report for CI consumption (works with Jenkins)
- ability to run not only ruby tests, but in principle - tests written in any language (language agnostic framework)
- ability to trigger test execution via email (tested with gmail) 

There is a "tests" directory included with 2 sample tests.
To get started, simply clone this workspace and execute:

rake

To see keywords in action, try:

rake KEYWORDS=passing

and

rake KEYWORDS=failing

For more info and usage run:

rake help
